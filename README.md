## About Me
From a young age, I have always been inclined to think outside the box. I might not have put much effort into things and often disliked the idea of intense work or fierce competition. I was more focused on progress, but it felt like I was often stumbling over the same obstacles.

I began my studies in science at one of the most prestigious institutions in South America. I took courses in chemistry, biology, physics, computing, and mathematics. I found myself particularly drawn to pure mathematics, guided by the esteemed career mentor (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Dickenstein).

Initially, I made great friends, but over time, I withdrew from the community. Influenced perhaps by Dostoevsky and Foucault, I chose to pursue knowledge independently, without conforming to traditional examination standards. This approach did not end well.

After having a child, I started working in the rapidly expanding software industry. It was challenging for me to integrate into this field, and during that period, I read Marx and related authors. I found myself in a dilemma between supporting my family and pursuing my deeper intellectual interests. In recent years, I have identified myself as a Christian and a Peronist.

Currently, I am a regular software developer with experience in creating medium-impact cloud-based data applications, adhering to best practices from the US and NATO industries. I am now studying Artificial Intelligence and delving deeper into its concepts and theories.
